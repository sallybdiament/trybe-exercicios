            <h2>Fatos sobre o Stomatopoda</h2>
            <p>Mantis shrimp, or stomatopods, are carnivorous marine crustaceans of the order Stomatopoda, branching
                from other members of the class Malacostraca around 340 million years ago.[2] Mantis shrimp typically
                grow to around 10 cm (3.9 in) in length, while a few can reach up to 38 cm (15 in).[3] A mantis shrimp's
                carapace (the hard, thick shell that covers crustaceans and some other species) covers only the rear
                part of the head and the first four segments of the thorax. Varieties range in colour from shades of
                brown to vivid colours, with more than 450 species of mantis shrimp being known. They are among the most
                important predators in many shallow, tropical and subtropical marine habitats. However, despite being
                common, they are poorly understood, as many species spend most of their lives tucked away in burrows and
                holes.[4]

                Called "sea locusts" by ancient Assyrians, "prawn killers" in Australia,[5] and now sometimes referred
                to as "thumb splitters"—because of the animal's ability to inflict painful wounds if handled
                incautiously[6]—mantis shrimp have powerful raptorials that are used to attack and kill prey either by
                spearing, stunning, or dismembering. Some mantis shrimp species have specialised calcified "clubs" that
                can strike with great power, while others have sharp forelimbs used to seize the prey (hence the term
                "mantis" in its common name).
